# APBS Build Dependencies

See `./build.sh --help` for options.

Currently, only the following libraries are working:

- FETK
- pybind11
- eigen3

Please see the `example-run.sh` in the top level directory. The option `-P` or
`--create-package` will generate a tarball and activation script to configure
the paths.
